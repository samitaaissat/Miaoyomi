# Contributing to Uchiyomi

Thanks for your interest. Bug reports, feature ideas, and pull requests are all welcome.

## Project layout
- `bff/`: the Fastify + TypeScript API (auth, library scanner, image server, sources, scheduled updater).
- `web/`: the Next.js PWA (reader, library, discover, admin).
- `docs/`: the user guide and screenshots. Screenshots are **generated**, not hand-taken — see [docs/SCREENSHOTS.md](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md) and re-run the rig if you change a screen.
- Site-specific source adapters are deliberately **not** in this repo. The loader registers any compiled
  CommonJS plugin mounted at `/sources`; the contract is in `bff/src/lib/sources/loader.ts`.

## Run Miaoyomi locally
```bash
cp .env.miaoyomi.example .env
MIAOYOMI_COMPOSE_MODE=dev bash scripts/miaoyomi-setup.sh --config-only
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```
Open http://localhost:8080 and create the administrator. The development overlay builds the app and novel
engine from this checkout; it is intentionally layered over the same database, volumes and sidecars used by
the prebuilt deployment.

## Pull requests
- Keep changes focused: one topic per PR.
- Match the existing TypeScript style and formatting.
- For anything user-facing, a short note in `docs/USAGE.md` is appreciated.
- Please don't hardcode new default sources that point at specific sites. The engine system already reaches whole families of sites by URL, which is the point.

## Tests
Run them with `npm test` in `bff/` or `web/` (**Node 22+**, matching CI and the Dockerfiles; the runner is
Node's built-in test runner via `tsx`,
so there's nothing extra to install beyond `npm install`).

Most tests are plain unit tests over pure helpers. A few rules — the reading-progress ones — are enforced in
SQL, so they run against a real Postgres and are skipped unless you point them at one:

```
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:5432/uchiyomi_test npm test
```

CI runs both suites (with a throwaway Postgres) on every pull request.

If you're fixing a bug, a test that fails before the fix and passes after is the most useful thing you can
add — several of the existing ones exist because something broke quietly and nobody noticed for weeks.
