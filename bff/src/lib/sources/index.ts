 * `down`, and earned the source the same escalating cooldown as a site refusing us -- which then stopped it
 * being asked at all. That is how Aqua Manga, answering correctly in about 11.5 seconds against an 8 second
 * budget, vanished from Discover entirely while every check reported it healthy. Being slower than our own
 * patience is not a fault of the source, and the caller now has a way to tell the difference.
