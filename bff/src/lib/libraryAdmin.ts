// Destructive library operations: hide a series, restore it, and merge one into another.
//
// Deleting HIDES rather than erases. The id survives, so favourites, ratings, notes and -- above all --
// reading history stay attached to something real, the action is undoable, and we never have to choose
// between erasing someone's reading events (which silently rewrites their stats, streaks and Wrapped) and
// leaving a dead series in Trending. persistScan() knows to skip a hidden folder, or the next scan would
// simply bring it back under a new id.
//
// Merging does NOT de-duplicate chapters, deliberately. Every chapter row and every progress row survives
// exactly as it is. The moment you delete a chapter because it looks like a duplicate, you have to fold two
// read_progress rows into one, and getting that wrong silently marks chapters unread -- which then syncs
// outward to the user's AniList account and cannot be undone. Duplicate chapter numbers are a tidiness
// problem the health page can surface; lost reading progress is not recoverable.
