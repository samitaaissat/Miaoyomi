// Check the sources and extensions on a schedule, so a dead one is noticed by the server rather than by a
// reader wondering why a dot is grey.
//
// This exists because of a real six-week failure. Aqua Manga -- 189 of 215 series on the install this was
// written for -- had its domain quietly repurposed into an unrelated website. The adapter kept returning an
// empty list, which throws nothing, so nothing was ever recorded and the source went on reporting healthy.
// Two more sites had moved their listing path and failed the same silent way, one of them for months.
//
// What it will do on its own is deliberately narrow. A moved domain has exactly one correct answer and is
// verifiable before committing to it, so it is followed automatically. Everything else -- markup drift, a CDN
// refusing us, a dead host -- is reported and left alone, because "disable it" and "wait, it is a blip" look
// identical from here, and getting that wrong turns a two-hour outage into a source nobody notices is off.
//
// Extension updates used to be the second thing it did on its own. They are their own scheduled job now
// (lib/extensionMonitor.ts), because they need the engine's repositories re-read first -- which this never
// did, so it installed updates it could not see -- and because two schedulers with two busy flags can drive
// the same install mutation at once.
