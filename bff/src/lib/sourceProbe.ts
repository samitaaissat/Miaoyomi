// Go and look at a source, right now, and report what you find.

// Two things live here and they answer different questions:
//   `smokeTest` -- does the ADAPTER work? Search, series, chapters, pages, in order, with details.
//   `probeBase` -- does the SITE answer, without the Cloudflare solver in the way?
//
// The second exists because the first cannot tell you why. On the install this was written against, six
// sources were failing for three unrelated reasons that were indistinguishable in the database: a domain
// that had moved twice, two sites returning 403 to this server's IP, and a solver whose own browser kept
// crashing. One plain HTTP request to each homepage separated all three in under a second.

 * scraping after answering. Behind a button an admin can press repeatedly, that matters.
 *
 * The search loop tries several terms because a site with few titles can legitimately miss one. It now stops
 * early when the failure is *classifiable*: a 403, a rate limit or a dead solver will answer identically for
 * all four terms, so trying the rest costs four times as long to learn nothing. Only a parse-shaped failure
 * (returned nothing, threw nothing) justifies another term, and that is exactly the case this is for.
