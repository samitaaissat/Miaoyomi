/**
 * Keeping the installed Mihon/Tachiyomi extensions current with the repositories they came from.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX. An auto-updater was already here: the daily source watchdog called
 * `updateExtensions()`, which installed anything the engine flagged `hasUpdate`. It had almost certainly
 * never updated anything on its own, on any install, because of one missing call.
 *
 * Suwayomi does not poll. It recomputes "an update is available" only when its repositories are re-read --
 * the `fetchExtensions` mutation, our `refreshExtensions()`. That was called from exactly three places, all
 * of them admin buttons. So the nightly job read a catalogue whose freshness depended on a human having
 * pressed Refresh, found `hasUpdate: false` on everything, and reported success. On the install this was
 * written for: one repository, 1394 extensions known, 15 installed, 0 flagged -- while upstream pushed
 * roughly every fifteen hours.
 *
 * A guard that only re-ordered the two calls would fix the symptom. What this module adds beyond that is
 * everything the missing call was hiding:
 *
 *   * A refresh that FAILS is now an outcome with a name. Before, an unreachable repository and a genuinely
 *     up-to-date catalogue produced the same silence.
 *   * The repository URLs are kept here as well as in the engine. They lived only in the engine's own
 *     settings, inside the volume people delete when it misbehaves, and they are not in our backup -- so
 *     wiping that volume silently un-configured the whole feature with nothing to restore from.
 *   * A snapshot of the catalogue, so "new upstream", "dropped upstream" and "an extension we had is gone"
 *     are questions that can be answered at all.
 *
 * Its own job rather than a step in the watchdog, on purpose. The watchdog is a daily, deliberately serial
 * scrape of every source at up to 45 seconds each; this is one index download and one list query. Coupling
 * them means either running the expensive thing four times a day or catching a push a day late. Two
 * schedulers driving the same install mutation with two separate busy flags is also how you get one APK
 * installed twice at once, which is why the watchdog's copy is removed rather than kept as a fallback.
