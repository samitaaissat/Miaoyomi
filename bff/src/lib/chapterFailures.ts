// One place that says which chapter of which series failed, and why.
//
// Until this existed a failed chapter was `failed++` in the updater and a bumped counter on a job card in the
// fill loop, and the error itself was discarded on the spot. "12 chapters could not be saved" was the whole
// record: which series, which chapter, which source and why existed nowhere. Live, one night's sweep lost
// 164 of 226 series to a single chapter and `docker logs` had nothing to show for it. And because the next
// sweep recomputes `missing` from scratch and takes the oldest, it re-attempted the same doomed chapters every
// night, which is why that number was constant rather than shrinking.
//
// Two outputs from one call: a log line a person can grep, and one row per MISSING chapter (not per attempt)
// that the health page reads and persistScan deletes the moment the chapter lands.
