# Run as the uid that actually owns your library, then drop privileges -- and, when no database was given,
# run one.
#
# Uchiyomi can rename and delete files in your library now, and a container running as uid 10002 cannot write
# a library owned by you. The usual fix people are told is `chown -R 10002 /your/manga`, which takes ownership
# of a personal media collection that a NAS share, another app and your own login also use. So instead this
# runs as YOUR uid, the linuxserver.io convention that most self-hosters already expect, and your files stay
# yours.
#
# WITH PUID/PGID UNSET THIS MUST BE A NO-OP. An existing install keeps running as 10002, byte for byte, and
# never starts as root at all. That is not politeness: v0.5.1 was entirely a volume-ownership bug (a fresh
# install could not write /config, so the JWT secret could not be saved and everyone was signed out on every
# restart), and this script is now the thing standing between that failure and a repeat of it.
#
# EMBEDDED POSTGRES. With DATABASE_URL unset, this starts a Postgres of its own on a unix socket, in /data/pg,
# and points the app at it; with DATABASE_URL set, nothing below the "embedded" line runs and the container
# behaves exactly as it always has. That one variable is the whole switch, so an existing install with an
# external database cannot drift into this path by accident.
#
# Why an entrypoint and not an init system: if Postgres dies the right outcome is for the CONTAINER to exit
# and `restart: unless-stopped` to bring both halves back in order, which is the opposite of what an init
# system's restart-the-service semantics would do to a database. tini stays PID 1; this script is the
# supervisor for exactly two processes and knows which one is the database.
