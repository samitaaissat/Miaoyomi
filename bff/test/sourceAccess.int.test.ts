// Two holes this file exists to keep closed, both found in production:
//
//  1. `canDownload: false` was enforced in exactly ONE place in the whole server -- POST /api/sources/add.
//     Every GET the Discover page uses was ungated, so a denied account could list every source, search
//     them, browse their newest pages and read full series detail. It only met a wall on the last button.
//
//  2. Nothing anywhere consulted `max_age_rating` for sources. On the install this was written against, 36
//     of 44 enabled sources are adult and 8 of the 10 English ones are, so a 6+ account's Discover page was
//     mostly adult covers. The signal to filter on was arriving from Suwayomi the whole time (`isNsfw` in
//     SOURCES_Q) and being discarded.
//
// It must be driven over HTTP rather than by calling the library. The web app is a static export, so a
// filter that only ran in the UI would leave `GET /api/sources/latest?source=<adult-id>` serving 24 adult
// covers as JSON to a capped child account, with the ids enumerable from `GET /api/sources`.
