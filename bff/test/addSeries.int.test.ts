// Adding a series from a source, driven through the real function rather than read as text.
//
// The existing guard for this path, addAsync.test.ts, is twelve regexes over the source file. It is worth
// keeping -- it stops someone re-editing those particular lines -- but it executes nothing, and an earlier
// version of it matched the COMMENT explaining a fix rather than the fix. None of the three faults below
// would have moved it.
//
//  1. A source that answered without a title fell back to the literal string 'Series', which becomes the
//     folder name. So a getSeries that timed out while listChapters succeeded filed the title under
//     `<Source>/Series` -- and the next title to do the same was told "already in library" and quietly
//     merged onto that same shelf. A network hiccup could collapse unrelated series into one, which is
//     library corruption dressed up as a successful add.
//
//  2. The shared detail cache stored the FAILURE too. A timeout produced `{ series: null, chapters: [] }`,
//     which was cached for ninety seconds and then reported as a confident 404: "No readable chapters for
//     this title on this source. Try a different source." Retrying inside the window repeated the same
//     wrong advice. Before the cache existed the identical catch was there and a retry simply worked; the
//     cache is what made a hiccup stick.
//
//  3. The download loop counted chapters it had not written. Its catch handled `blockStatus` and swallowed
//     everything else -- a full disk, a permission error, an unparseable chapter -- while `j.done++` ran
//     anyway and the job finished `done`. A disk-full add filled the bar to 100%, showed the green tick, and
//     landed nothing.
//
// Skipped automatically unless TEST_DATABASE_URL is set.
