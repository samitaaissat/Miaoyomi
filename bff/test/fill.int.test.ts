// ComicInfo <Series>, and every persistScan re-reads the FIRST chapter's ComicInfo and overwrites the series
// row's title, summary, author, status, genres and web from it (lib/library.ts, ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE). A
// fill repairs the START of a series, so it writes the new first chapter. Pass the candidate's title as meta
// and the series silently renames itself for everyone on the next scan -- and it fires when the match is
// RIGHT, because a right match is usually under a different English title. That is not a hypothetical: the
// series that prompted this feature is listed as "Mr Devourer, Please Act Like a Final Boss" elsewhere.
