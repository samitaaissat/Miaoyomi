// The compose files people actually install from must carry the safety settings the dev one documents.
//
// Three compose files describe the same optional extension engine, and they had drifted apart. The
// development file said, in a comment, that the engine "must never write into" the library and set
// AUTO_DOWNLOAD_CHAPTERS=false to enforce it. deploy/docker-compose.yml -- the file the README tells people
// to `curl -O` -- set only TZ. So every install done the documented way ran an engine that would happily
// download chapters into its own volume the first time an extension-backed series was followed: a second,
// invisible copy of the library that nothing manages, prunes, or backs up.
//
// The split file had the env line but not DOWNLOAD_AS_CBZ, and none of the three had a healthcheck, so a
// wedged JVM looked identical to a healthy one in `docker ps` and the app's only clue was a timeout.
//
// Static text checks on purpose: there is no YAML parser in the dependency list, adding one to assert on
// four lines would be the wrong trade, and the failure mode here is "a line is missing from a file", which
// text can see perfectly well.
