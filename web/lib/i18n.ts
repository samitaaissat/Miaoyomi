// Translation, for a statically exported app.
//
// Next's own i18n routing needs a server, and this ships as `output: 'export'` behind nginx or the API
// itself -- so locale lives in the client, not in the URL. That rules out next-intl's main value (routing
// and server components) and leaves a dictionary and a hook, which is all ~200 strings need.
//
// WHERE THE CHOICE LIVES. In `app_settings`, which is free-form JSONB merged on write, so a language follows
// someone to their phone with no migration. localStorage mirrors it because the login screen has to be
// translated before anyone is signed in, and because reading it synchronously on first paint is what stops
// the app flashing English and then swapping.
//
// English is the source. A key IS its English string, so a missing translation degrades to correct English
// rather than to `home.nav.library`, and adding a string never requires touching nine files at once.
